# CSE469
UW CSE469 WI2020 Lab(Software)<br>
The labs in this course build on each other and this is my final result.<br>
Through the quarter, I have been building a CPU similar to ARM (for sure I cannot achieve all functions and I expect the current functions to be buggy otherwise I would not be here now) in SystemVerilog.<br>
The program should be run in SystemVerilog simulator, I include a series of binary instructions in the code memory, you can find the corresponding instructions in a txt file called test_commands.<br>
Good luck with the course **(especially if you are taking this with Mark Oskin)** future students.<br>
If you are not a student, you'd better close this page and do something more meaningful.<br>
